It felt like we were in a high school cafeteria. There was so much noise from people talking over each other and from the loud music. We were just happy that we didn't have to share a table with another couple. \r\n\r\nFinally - Food was mediocre. I was extremely disappointed with the curry egg noodle dish. It was awkward to eat and I felt sick about half way through because the curry was too rich. On the flip side - I had a taste of my company's dish and it wasn't that great either - he had the beef stir fry dish with rice.

I wanted a little desert so I went to this doughnut shop it seemed clean enough so I made my selections and took them home. Mistake should have eaten one there I would have ask for my money back. I took a bite out of each on to confirm what I thought they were the worst doughnuts I have ever had. Horrible not sure if the oils was rancid or not hot enough either way eat at your own risk."

Upon sitting down we were told we could only have one of the very small table tops there were two together so the hostess told us the manager said we couldn't use two table tops in the empty restaurant.

But whenever you need to quickly apply some simple processing to a collection of data you have a new technique that will help you to do just that. It'll also be useful if you're reading someone else's code that happens to use lambdas."
